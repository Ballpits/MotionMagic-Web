# Motion Magic

## Project Description

**Motion Magic** is an interactive 2D physics visualization tool designed to simplify complex physics concepts for educational purposes. Inspired by the challenges faced in physics class, the aim is to create a user-friendly platform that allows for intuitive scene creation and interaction visualization.

**Motion Magic** is designed first-hand with a focus on user experience. **Motion Magic** is built with Angular, and utilizing the Matter-js physics library for physics simulation. Key features include intuitive object manipulation, a comprehensive watch panel, scene saving capabilities, and automated text-to-scene generation.

The ultimate goal is to provide a seamless learning experience, enabling users to concentrate on learning physics concepts without the hassle of navigating complex software interfaces. This tool is designed to be an aid for educators and students alike, facilitating the creation, sharing, and visualization of diverse physics scenarios with ease.

## Developing

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
